DB2 date conversion rules.

This file contains reusable templates for DB2 date comparison conversion.

No program name is hardcoded.
No table name is hardcoded.
No DCLGEN group name is hardcoded.
No business field name is hardcoded.

The composer supplies dynamic values such as:
- field_name
- group_name
- helper
- condition
- indent

# that appears in a comparison is first realigned into a HELP- helper.
